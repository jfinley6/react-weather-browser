# React Weather Browser

A weather app which allows users to receive up to the minute weather for cities across America. Weather information includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, sundown and sun up time as well as a condition icon. Users can click the red star to add it to their favorites for easy access or alternatively remove it. These favorites will be unique for each browser that accesses the page by storing them in Local Storage. Users can toggle between light/dark and fahrenheight/celcius mode. Both of these options will also be stored in Local Storage
